SamsungDataCleanScript
======================

This repository is peer assessment project from Getting and Cleaning Data course on Coursera, the MOOC (massive open online course). There is a R script in the repository. The R script is used to clean and process data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

The link for raw data is: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

Run_analysis.R, the R script, produces a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. There are some comments in the R script as detail guidelines for how to use the R script. 

There are several main procedures the R script has:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 

Above four procedures are all for the final goal - producing tidy data set. 

Feel free to contact with me if you have any suggestions or questions for the R script.
